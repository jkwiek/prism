# Pronoun Relations in Social Media (PRISM): 2nd vs 3rd person pronoun frequency in social media comments in relation to various poster and commenter attributes

## Description
The goal of this project is to examine the prevalence of social media comments featuring 2nd person pronouns (you) and 3rd person pronouns (he/she) based on metrics relating to the post and commenter. The findings may be helpful in understanding the psychology behind social media interactions by providing a unique perspective on how people perceive their online conversations.

For the initial phase of the project, the focus is exclusively on the TikTok platform. In future iterations, it may be useful to compare the "cultures" of various platforms based on the linguistic tendencies of their commenters. 


From the post-end, I am examining the following factors:
- number of likes/views/comments on the post
- size of poster's following
- follower/following ratio of poster
- number of comments on post
- duration of video
- verified status
- frequency of posts*
- average amount of like, comment, and views for entire account
- length of video description
- number of posts* on account

From the commenter-end, I will examine the following factors:
- number of comments on the commenter's own posts
- duration for which commenter has been on a platform
- number of posts made by the commenter
- size of commenter's following
- follower/following ratio of commenter
- time difference between poster and commenter*
- number of posts of commenter
- size of commenter's following
- average like, comments, and views on commenter's videos
- frequency of commenter's posts*
